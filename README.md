# CS255SystemsAnalysisAndDesign
Part of my Portfolio for CS 255 with SNHU, System Analysis and Design

Learning System Analysis and Design we created documents for an imaginary DriverPass client.  Their goal was to help students pass their driver's test to get a DMV license by offering online training and driving sessions.
I summarized the system adequately.  Not having real-world experience at the time of this writing, I'm not sure what needs to be improved.
I interpretted the user's needs by capturing them and making them a function of the DriverPass system.  Users need to login, access training, schedule or manage driving appointments, etc.
I approached from multiple UML design angles.  Use cases, sequence diagrams, and basic UMLs were composed to help visualize and specify elements of the design, both behaviorally and functionally.
My current approach to designing software begins with gaining an understanding of the needs of the system and then designing them in some organized way before development begins.
